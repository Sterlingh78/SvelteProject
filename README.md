# DGM3790 Svelte Project

Here you will find my personal project for learning Svelte in DGM3790. Below I have specified where certain features can be found within the app.
(Note: I had to make a new Repo for this project at the beginning of October due to issues I was having with the original)

## DOM Events

News route populates page with article data after clicking on article image in the side drawer. [News](https://github.com/Sterlingh78/SvelteProject/blob/master/src/routes/news/%2Bpage.svelte)

Signup route has basic form validation for creating a password. [Sign Up](https://github.com/Sterlingh78/SvelteProject/blob/master/src/routes/auth/signup/%2Bpage.svelte)

I have implemented a theme changer in the drop-down menu using an event to store the theme in local storage. [Theme Change in Header](https://github.com/Sterlingh78/SvelteProject/blob/master/src/lib/components/header/Header.svelte)
